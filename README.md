<h3><b>Collection of Bioinformatics Scripts in BASH</b></h3>

The BASH scripts were used in bioinformatical analysis of next-generation sequencing data from genomic DNase I cleavage samples. 
  Aggregated_Plot: Distinct binding profile of transcription factors were visualized while aggregated DNase I cleavage was plotted to distances from the motif centers. 

  Cleavage_Heatmap: Distinct binding profile of transcription factors were visualized while DNase I cleavage was plotted to distances from the motif center on heatmap.  

  Conservation_Plot: Sequence conservation of the motif instances were plotted to distance from motif centers. 

  Cut_Counts_and_Density: The counts of DNase I cleavage for each nucleotide were calculated, and density files were generated across the genome. 

  DESeq: Sequencing data of microbial cultures at various growht stages were compared with the R package "DESeq" to test for differential sensitivity to DNase I cleavage. 

  FIMO: The genome was scanned with FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurences) to locate potential motif instances of the known transcription factors. 

  Footprints_Location: The footprints were summarized according to their relative distance from the nearest transcription start sites, gene starts, or sigma factor binding sites. 

  Fragment_VPlot: DNase I cleavage were visualized as V-shape gaps while the length of paired-end sequencing fragments was plotted to distances from the motif centers. 

  Genome_Alignment: Sequencing reads were aligned to unique positions of microbial genome with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. 

  MEME: Binding motifs of transcription factors were detected with MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) of the MEME Suite, the motif-based sequence analysis tools. 

  SPP: DNase I hypersensitive sites were located with the R package "SPP" as regions condensed with sequencing tags.
